# Principal Component Analysis
This is an implementation of Pricipal Component Analysis Algorithm that makes use of covariance method. For the theoretical descirption of the algorithm, please refer to the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis.

This plot belows shows how inital data were transformed to new coordinates with maximum covariances of each features:
